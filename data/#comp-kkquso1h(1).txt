Past Experiences
Domain: Healthcare
​
An algorithm was developed using computer vision techniques (including facial feature analysis, eye detection, DL) to help users in analyzing their skin on parameters like wrinkles, pores, spots, texture & shine.

Based on these, the system could detect skin problems in the early stages and even suggest suitable skin-care products.
